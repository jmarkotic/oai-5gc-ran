# openairinterface 5GC SA + O-RAN CU/DU + UE e2e setup

Simulation of real use case with 5GC SA and O-RAN components (CU, DU) running on multuple K8s clustes.

Project is WIP.

## Project scope
Scope:
*   Deploy o-ran components in different O-RAN deployment models
*   deploy similar network conditions as used in production networks (multiple netowrk interfaces to support highspeec/low latency traffic)
*   use SR-IOV, DPDK, multus
*   upgrade with additional scenarios like network slicing and RIC use cases
*   etc.
